            <h3>Academic</h3>
            <p>Born and raised just a mile from Boston, I am no stranger to harsh winters. Or at least that's what I told myself before going to central New York for college. Syracuse had been a dream school of mine throughout all of high school. I had no idea how I would ever be able to decide on a major, however, I knew that any path I took, Syracuse would be able to offer me great instruction. Would it be Newhouse, for communications? Whitman, for business? In high school, I had always excelled in my technology electives, but I had never considered it a career path or major until I learned about the iSchool. <br> <br> Information Management & Technology: Combining my interest in business with my aptitude for technology sounded like everything I had been looking for wrapped up into one degree. Once I started my technology courses, I realized just how interested I was in the entire field, from IT Management to different programming languages. Python, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JS were a part of my curriculum that I was intimidated by, however, I ended up finding new hobbies and interests through these courses. The iSchool's focus on working with teams has set me up for success and prepared me for the prelimiary years of my career. As invigorating, significant, and special my experience at SU has been, I feel fully equipped for the future thanks to my professors, advisors, and classmates at the iSchool. </p>

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>In the summer of 2017 I was lucky enough to be employed by HCL Technologies, Ltd. as a Technical Project Management Intern. This was the first experience out of the classroom that allowed me to take a glimpse into what my future was going to be like. I was, and still am, incredibly excited. As a student with a project management concentration, I was excited to be helping my supervisors with constructing and reviewing technical RFP documents and providing feedback to directors who appreciated a youthful viewpoint. My main focus of the summer, however, was mapping the organizational processes into one cohesive, easy-to-use, easy-to-access document and uploading it to a sharepoint for all employees to utilize. Previously, the processes were either entirely undocumented or simply unorganized. My communication and organization skills were vastly improved and I got to utilize my technical skills by working on the sharepoint and filing through dated Excel documents. Although my time at HCL was limited to one summer, my time there was maximized by exercising skills I had previously obtained, and I am excited for any position that will grow this list of skills. <br> <br> Working in the restaurant industry has taught me invaluable skills I have always and will always use in my every day life. Whether it be time management, multi-tasking, staying level-headed and in-control under stressful time constraints, or even proper phone-etiquette, these skills are not something I could have learned in a classroom. My past customer service positions in a bustling tourist destination for more than 7 summers morphed my previously young, introverted, and hesitant self into a confident, poised, and devoted worker who thrives in fast-paced environments. </p>
